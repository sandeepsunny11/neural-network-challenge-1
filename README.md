# neural-network-challenge-1
The challenge assignment involves classifying student loan repayment status as either 0 or 1. To achieve this, a neural network with two hidden layers was implemented. The first hidden layer contains 6 neurons, while the second has 3 neurons. These hidden layers connect to an output layer, which performs the final classification. The input layer has 11 features and is connected directly to the first hidden layer.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, with binary cross-entropy as the loss function and accuracy as the evaluation metric. The training process resulted in a 78% accuracy on the training set and 75% accuracy on both the validation and test sets. The modelâ€™s weights were saved and reloaded to re-run predictions on the test data. Finally, a classification report was generated to present the results, detailing metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
